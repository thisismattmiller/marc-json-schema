      <strong>h - Microform</strong>

      <div class="description">
        One-character alphabetic code that indicates the category
        of material to which the item belongs is
        <strong>microform</strong>. Microform is a generic term
        for any medium, transparent or opaque, bearing
        microimages. A <em>microimage</em> is a unit (e.g., a
        page) of textual, graphic, or computer-generated material
        that is contained on aperture cards, microfiche,
        microfilm, microopaques, or other microformats and that
        is too small to be read without magnification. Microforms
        may be reproductions of existing textual or graphic
        materials or they may be original publications. A fill
        character (|) is not allowed in this position.

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>a - Aperture card</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Card with one or more rectangular opening(s), or
        aperture(s), specifically prepared for the mounting or
        insertion of a piece of photographic film containing one
        or more microimage(s). The cards are usually EAM
        (Electrical Accounting Machine) punched cards, commonly
        known as IBM cards, that are standardized for use in
        card-handling machines. Such cards contain only one
        aperture and most frequently have only one microimage.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>b - Microfilm cartridge</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Consists of a strip of photographic film wound onto a
        single core (or hub), housed in a protective container.
        Microfilm cartridges require reading equipment (readers
        and reader-printers) that is specifically adapted for
        their use. Normally, the end of the film is left free for
        threading into such equipment. Common film lengths,
        widths, and reduction ratios are the same as those of
        microfilm reels.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>c - Microfilm cassette</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Analogous to the sound tape cassette. Consists of a strip
        of photographic film wound onto a double core, housed in
        a protective container. Microfilm cassettes require
        reading equipment (readers and reader-printers) that is
        specifically adapted for their use. Because they are
        double-cored, they are not threaded when used in such
        readers and reader-printers. Usual film lengths are 100
        ft (approximately 30 m.) or less. Common film width is 16
        mm. and usual reduction ratios are those of microfilm
        reels and cartridges.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>d - Microfilm reel</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Consists of a strip of photographic film wound onto an
        unenclosed flanged holder (or reel). Microfilm reels
        require manual threading when used in readers and
        reader-printers and require equipment that is adapted for
        their use. Film lengths are usually 100 ft.
        (approximately 30 m.) or less. For microimages produced
        by filming textual and graphic materials, the most common
        film widths are 35 mm. and 16 mm. and reduction ratios
        commonly range from about 10:1 to about 20:1. Sixteen
        millimeter film with effective ratios of either 24:1 or
        48:1 is most often used for COM
        (Computer-Output-Microfilm) microimages.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>e - Microfiche</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Transparent sheet of photographic film containing
        microimages arranged in a grid pattern (a two-dimensional
        array) and having a heading that contains identifying
        information in text that is large enough to be read
        without magnification. Grid patterns vary with reduction
        ratios.
      </div>

      <div class="description3">
        Microfiches are grouped in five ranges of reduction
        ratios: low reduction (ratios up to and including 15:1),
        normal reduction (ratios greater than 15:1 up to and
        including 30:1), high reduction (ratios greater than 30:1
        up to and including 60:1), very high reduction (ratios
        greater than 60:1 up to and including 90:1) and ultrahigh
        reduction (ratios greater than 90:1).
      </div>

      <div class="description3">
        The most common microfiche are made by filming textual or
        graphic material at a reduction ratio of approximately
        24:1. Such microfiche are 105 mm. high and 148 mm. wide
        (approximately 4x6 in.) and have a grid pattern that
        accommodates 98 microimages made from documents that are
        no more than 11 in. high and 8 1/2 in. wide. The heading
        area is the width of one row and is found directly above
        the first row of microimages.
      </div>

      <div class="description3">
        The most common COM (Computer-Output-Microfilm)
        microfiche are made by recording computer-generated data
        at an effective reduction ratio of 48:1 on a 105 mm. x
        148 mm. sheet of film. Such microfiche have a grid
        pattern of 15 rows and 18 columns, comprising 270
        microimages. The heading area is the width of one row and
        is found directly above the first row of microimages.
      </div>

      <div class="description3">
        Microfiche made at ultrahigh ratios are commonly called
        ultrafiche. Ratios and grid patterns have not been
        standardized for these microfiche and differ according to
        application and method for production.

      For microfilm created by other than COM
      (Computer-Output-Microfilm) processes and for microopaque
      microprints, codes a and b are most likely to be used. For
      COM microfiche or microfilm, the reduction ratio is
      actually an expansion ratio and refers to the ratio of
      expansion required to produce a legible image. Most COM is
      created at 024-048 reduction ratios (codes b and c), though
      some COM fiche is at higher ratios (e.g., 072). Codes b-e
      are used with other types of microforms (e.g., microfiche,
      ultrafiche, etc.). The most commonly encountered microfiche
      are normal reduction (code b).

    <strong>06-08 - Reduction ratio</strong>

    <div class="description">
      Number specifying the reduction ratio for a microform,
      recorded as three digits. The number is right justified and
      each unused position contains a zero (e.g., 015, 048). A
      hyphen is used for any unknown portion of the reduction
      ratio (e.g., 03-, 1--, or ---).
    </div>

    <div class="description2 description">
      A code indicating the <em>reduction ratio range</em> is
      recorded in 007/05. Generally, the specific reduction ratio
      is recorded when it is ultra high (code e in 007/05). If
      the ratio is not ultra high, recording the specific ratio
      is less essential. Three fill character (|||) are used when
      no attempt has been made to code this data element.
